# Recursive-Function-
Recursive function is a specialzed case where a function could call itself inside itself. 
A famous quote from Stephen Hawking about recursion is " To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion."  Using this program we could calculate the value of a function. In recursive function we replace the independent variable with a new variable and create a function that come up with a base value and could use itself to calculate its own value.
